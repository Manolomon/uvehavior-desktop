# Summary

According with Dugatkin (2020) [@Dugatkin:2020] Behavior is the coordinated responses of whole living organisms to internal and/or external stimuli, considering behavior as expression of activity of the nervous system. 
Neuroethology is the branch of neuroscience in charge of finding out which organic components, especially neurophysiological types, are involved in the display of behaviors [@Bassler:1984], reason why it is interested in the analysis of changes in the frequency, function and intensity of a certain behavior, which can be modified by different treatments, manipulations or the experience of individuals. For ethological study it is important to identify specific behaviors where they will be measured: latency, frequency and duration [@Inesta:2011].

On the other hand, before beginning a study on behavior, it is necessary to consider whether the design of the experiment is adequate to allow causal and logical explanations, orienting the investigation towards the adequate data interpretation. Experimental design consider the study subject, conditions of the environment and the control of the variables studied [@Kirk:2012]. In ethology, behavior was typically categorized by trained observers taking advantage of their experience and intuition to identify relevant elements, however Tinbergen’s definition leaves open the discussion of how behavior should be measured and represented [@Brown:2018].

# Statement of need 

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications  and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission by students and experts alike.
